TODO:
-Clean up code
	-add comments and docstrings
		-PEP257
	-helper functions
	-replace range() for loops with enumerate()
	-replace references to None (i.e. use Exceptions instead)
	-update functions to use keyword arguments
	-remove get and set methods
-Move Duel loigic from __main__.py to a new Duel class
-Store card data in db
	-write code to reference db data to create Card
-Possible CardController class?
	-handles Card overhead so Card class can just contain card data instead of things related to instance (i.e. position, is_set, etc...)
-Read DeckList data from .txt files
	-instead of having code to manually add all cards we want, store this data in a .txt file and choose which .txt file we want to use as our DeckList
-Implement MP2
-Implement Spell Cards + Effect Monsters
-Implement Fusion?
-GUI
-Implement connectivity?
	-so that both players don't play from the same screen/command line
